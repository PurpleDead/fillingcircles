# Filling Circels
That script came from a coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman. I watched his video and decided to challenge myself to exercise my learning. I know it's not very complicated and very simple, but it's worth the try.
The project already have some functionality. On its current state, it is a generator of growing circles. When the circles hit another one, they stop growing. Now, the next step is filling an image with those circles.
